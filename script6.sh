//Write a script that asks the user for two numbers and checks if they are equal, or if one is larger than the other. Provide appropriate output for each case. Tip: Use read to get numbers and if, elif, and else to compare them. //
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter the first number:"
read f
echo "Enter the second number:"
read s
if [ $f -eq $s ]
then
        echo "Both number are equal"
elif [ $f -lt $s ]
then
        echo "$f is less than to $s"
else
        echo "$f is greater than to $s"
fi
